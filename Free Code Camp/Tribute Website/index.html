<p class="c"><br>Though each movie was a recipient of more awards than posted on this website.</p>
<p class="c">Miyazaki stated several times over the years that he wanted to retire, but on September 7, 2013, stated that he was "quite serious" this time. Having turned 72 the previous January, he felt that after 50 years, he'd been in the industry long enough and it was time to hand the reins over to younger staff. He also added that "At my age, I can't work long hours like I used to." However, he plans on pursuing new goals, such as working on the Studio Ghibli Museum, on which he commented "I might even become an exhibit myself". Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki revealed that Miyazaki will continue to illustrate manga and is currently working on a serialized samurai series. Fellow animator Isao Takahata has publicly stated that he believes Miyazaki's retirement to be non-permanent. "...I think there is a decent chance that may change. I think so, since I've known him a long time. Don't be at all surprised if that happens." During a New Year's Eve radio show, broadcast on Tokyo FM, on December 31, 2013, Toshio Suzuki speculated that Miyazaki might revoke his latest retirement (apparently his sixth to date). On November 13, 2016, Miyazaki confirmed that he would be coming from retirement to work on a new film.</p>
